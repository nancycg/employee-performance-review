Front end: React
Back end: Node
Database: Mongodb(NoSQL)
Code Editor: VS code (Visual Studio)

Pre-requisite:

•Install mongoDB and run on your machine.
•Install node.js(v10.15.3) runtime environment 
•Install Node Package manager-npm(v6.4.1)

Important: 
Database with name ‘reviewdb’ will get created when you insert employee data using ‘Add Employee’ button. 
I did not use authentication in database for simplicity.

For better understanding of code, I have included detailed comments in code. Please review the code and find the assumptions and details there.
